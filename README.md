# TowersOfHanoi
Simple Tower of Hanoi game.

I wrote this game in about a week. It's a variation on the Tower of Hanoi game that has 3 disks and 3 pegs.

This variation has 32 levels where there are up to 6 pegs and 10 disks, as well as pegs that can't be used right away.

This game has been uploaded to 2 different casual gaming sites and my own website:
